       What is character encoding?
       <br>
        <p sytle="border:none; background-color:none; font-size:14px;">
                ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set). ASCII defined 128 different alphanumeric characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

                ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set also supported 256 different character codes.
                
                ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.
                
                Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.</p>
